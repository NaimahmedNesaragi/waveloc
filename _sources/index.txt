WaveLoc documentation
=====================

Thank you for trying out WaveLoc, the kurtosis and migration-based event
detector and locator.  Development of waveloc is being carried out as part of
the European Union funded NERA project.

This documentation is for the offline version of waveloc.  Development of a
real-time version is ongoing (see developement repository : https://github.com/amaggi/rt-waveloc).

Waveloc is open-source software. It is distributed under the CeCILL Free
Software License Agreement. Feel free to fork the sofware from 
http://github.com/amaggi/waveloc if you want to modify it, and please consider
contributing your modifications back to the central version.
